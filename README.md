# Heart Disease Prediction â€“ Logistic Regression

A machine learning project that predicts the presence of heart disease based on patient data using a Logistic Regression model in Python.

---

## Project Overview

- Dataset: `heart_disease_data.csv` containing 303 samples and 14 features including age, sex, cholesterol, blood pressure, and more.
- Task: Predict whether a patient has heart disease (`target` = 1) or not (`target` = 0).
- Features include:
  - Age, Sex, Chest Pain Type (cp)
  - Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps)
  - Cholesterol (chol)
  - Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
  - Resting ECG results (restecg)
  - Maximum Heart Rate (thalach)
  - Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
  - Oldpeak, Slope, CA, Thal
